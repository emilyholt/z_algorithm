# Z Algorithm Implementation
Lightning fast pattern matching in Python


### Setup + Install
The standalone `main.py` has no dependencies, and can by run with Python3

For a more interactive use-case, use the Jupyter Notebook, which will require installing the Python `jupyter` library. It is strongly encouraged to use [Python virtual environments](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation.html)(`virtualenv`) when installing these external libraries.

```
virtualenv virt
source virt/bin/activate
pip install jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

### Usage

Standalone script:
`python main.py <PATTERN> <INPUT STRING>`

Jupyter Notebook:
`jupyter notebook`
